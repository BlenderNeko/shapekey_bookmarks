This is a little addon for Blender that lets you "bookmark" shape keys for use during animating.

You can store bookmarked shapekeys in a group along with other shape keys and display these either in the armature data tab, and/or somewhere in de N-panel when in pose mode. It defaults to showing them in the Item category but this can be changed in the addons preferences.

You can create your bookmarks either from these panels or simply right click on a shape key, press "Bookmark shape key" (due to technical limitations this will only work when you are not hovering over the name of the shape key).
